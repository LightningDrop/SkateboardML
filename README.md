Classifying skateboarding tricks


16 June TODO:

- Gather video training data of tricks by searching for Creative Commons license in YouTube.
    We'll also need to maintain the links to all videos so we can properly credit them.
- Edit videos into 1 to 2 second clips of just the trick.
    Our goal is to have 100 clips of each trick.
    We should start by picking just two tricks- ollie and kickflip?
- (Maybe) start processing videos into homogeneous form: 30 frames / second at a specific length and resolution.
- Start reading up on background for video machine learning- is 100 clips of training data enough?

23 JUNE TODO:
- (Maybe) start processing videos into homogeneous form: 30 frames / second at a specific length and resolution.
- Finish gathering video training data
- ~Email Justin~
- Reading about background for video machine learning 


## Background reading

- [Google paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42455.pdf) describing training on large video dataset.
    We need to figure out how to do more with less- using only 100 or so videos of each class.
